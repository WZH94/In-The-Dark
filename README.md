# In The Dark
 In The Dark was made for the final project assignment of a class on Arduino. This game made with Processing follows with the same concept as a Digipen Singapore game, Lurking, where you have to use echolocation to see your surroundings. This is done through making sound into an Arduino setup with a microphone.
